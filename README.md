**Deliverable 1**

7 February, 2022

1. *What was your goal for this deliverable, as defined on your Learning Plan?*
2. Review my Javascript and HTML knowledge
3. *Did you meet this goal? If not, why?*
4. Yes, I remembered and researched on how Javascript and HTML work since it had been a while since I'd worked with either of them. I created a few lines of code with both with what I could remember, and learned or relearned other parts of code using CodeHS and the internet.
5. *What needs to happen for you to stay on schedule from this point forward (e.g., change of plan, putting in extra time, getting help, etc.)?*
6. Nothing really, I just need to keep working on my project consistently and follow my timeline that I created.

What I've learned so far is mostly just relearning and reminding myself of how HTML and Javascript works
