**Deliverable 2 -**
6 March, 2022

1. *What was your goal for this deliverable, as defined on your Learning Plan?*
2. Create the landscape of the game by actually coding in the maze with textures.
3. *Did you meet this goal? If not, why?*
4. No, I wasn't able to meet this goal by the time of the deliverable. Instead of actually working on the maze, I diverged from my plan and instead focused on making the website that you visit in order to go to the maze. I wasn't planning on having this website, but realized I needed it to explain the game, the controls, and other aspects of the project.
5. *What needs to happen for you to stay on schedule from this point forward (e.g., change of plan, putting in extra time, getting help, etc.)?*
6. I think I need to stick to the plan in order to stay on schedule, and put in more time into the project. I also think that I would need to change the plan a little, because I've already gone away from it. I've decided that my goal of making the game more interactive through being able to place blocks was too ambitious would be way too complicated to do in a single semester. As a result, I'm changing that part of the plan so I can still complete the project.

So far what I've done in this class is I've started making my project. I've started using A-Frame to make my maze in VR, and I've relearned and reminded myself how to code using Javascript and HTML. After that, I started working on the actual website that will tell you the instructions for the game and will have the introduction. I also learned about CSS and how to use it, and how to use external, internal, and inline CSS in my HTML to make up the design of websites. I learned how to also use Bootstrap to make buttons on my website. That's mostly what I've done so far in computer coding 2. Example of using CSS to make a box:
```
div {
  width: 500px;
  border: 5px solid green;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: auto;
}
```


**Deliverable 1 -**
7 February, 2022

1. *What was your goal for this deliverable, as defined on your Learning Plan?*
2. Review my Javascript and HTML knowledge
3. *Did you meet this goal? If not, why?*
4. Yes, I remembered and researched on how Javascript and HTML work since it had been a while since I'd worked with either of them. I created a few lines of code with both with what I could remember, and learned or relearned other parts of code using CodeHS and the internet.
5. *What needs to happen for you to stay on schedule from this point forward (e.g., change of plan, putting in extra time, getting help, etc.)?*
6. Nothing really, I just need to keep working on my project consistently and follow my timeline that I created.

What I've learned so far for my project is mostly just relearning and reminding myself of how HTML and Javascript works, like tags in HTML or functions in Javascript, or just the format for either of them and how they work. I've also remembered how to use A-frame with HTML in Glitch to create a VR world where you can create shapes and move around in them. This is an example of HTML using A-frame where I created four cubes in different positions.
```
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -1" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-box position="-1 1.5 -1" color="blue"></a-box>
      <a-box position="-1 2.5 -1" color="purple"></a-box>
      <a-box position="1 0.5 -1" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
```
