**Deliverable 1**

7 February, 2022

1. *What was your goal for this deliverable, as defined on your Learning Plan?*
2. Review my Javascript and HTML knowledge
3. *Did you meet this goal? If not, why?*
4. Yes, I remembered and researched on how Javascript and HTML work since it had been a while since I'd worked with either of them. I created a few lines of code with both with what I could remember, and learned or relearned other parts of code using CodeHS and the internet.
5. *What needs to happen for you to stay on schedule from this point forward (e.g., change of plan, putting in extra time, getting help, etc.)?*
6. Nothing really, I just need to keep working on my project consistently and follow my timeline that I created.

What I've learned so far for my project is mostly just relearning and reminding myself of how HTML and Javascript works, like tags in HTML or functions in Javascript, or just the format for either of them and how they work. I've also remembered how to use A-frame with HTML in Glitch to create a VR world where you can create shapes and move around in them. This is an example of HTML using A-frame where I created four cubes in different positions.
```
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -1" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-box position="-1 1.5 -1" color="blue"></a-box>
      <a-box position="-1 2.5 -1" color="purple"></a-box>
      <a-box position="1 0.5 -1" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
```
