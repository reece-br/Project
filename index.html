      Welcome to the Maze Game, a game where you have to navigate a 3D VR maze to try to get to the center.
      But be careful - the maze is deadlier than it seems, and you'll have to defend yourself against dangerous
      monsters. 
      Use the arrow keys or WASD to move around. Look around by dragging with the mouse. Click on monsters to attack
      them. Click the Play button to begin.
